## Description
_We are all poets! As a user we want and need a place to share our collective skills. This is a place to share talents and bring in new and different ideas to our craft. Create a profile with your bio, profile image, a website link, skills you have learned and can offer. Your entries are then displayed to a portfolio page that will be shared with other like-minded individuals._
